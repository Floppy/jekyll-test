# Jekyll-Test

`jekyll-test` is a highly opinionated test configuration for Jekyll sites to let you create well-formed sites with minimal configuration, built on top of [html-proofer](https://github.com/gjtorikian/html-proofer).

It provides two rake tasks:

`jekyll:check` will test your site for HTML validity, internal link correctness, alt tags, OpenGraph validity, https usage, and a load more. It will complain about as much as it can. You want this to pass.

`jekyll:check_external_links` will check all outgoing links as well. This is a separate task as this often fails due to network errors, etc, and you don't want to depend on it passing. Use it for information only.

## Usage

Add this to your site's `Gemfile` (or just create the file with this content if it doesn't exist) and run `bundle`:

```ruby
source "https://rubygems.org"

gem 'rake'

group :test do
  gem 'jekyll-test'
end
```

Then add this to `Rakefile` (or create a file with just this in it if you don't have one):

```ruby
require 'jekyll/test/tasks'
```

We suggest making `jekyll:check` your default task by adding this line to `Rakefile` as well:

```rake
task default: "jekyll:check"
```

You can then run `rake` and bingo, your site will be tested with `html-proofer`.

### Travis configuration

To configure a travis build to run these tests, run:

```
rake jekyll:configure:travis
```

This will initialise your repo for use on travis, if necessary, then write a multi-build configuration which will run both checks together. The link check is allowed to fail, so it will not impact your CI success / failure.

WARNING: This will aggressively overwrite bits of `.travis.yml`, so if you already have one, make sure it's committed or backed up so you can check the changes.

It's a good idea to run the task with each new release of this gem to get the latest configuration.
